The FIT Stack - Flybase / Interface / Thin Servers

The FIT Stack allows for building rapid MVPs, it's set up so you can choose a full-stack version with Node.js as the backend, or the client-side version which is frontend only.

The frontend code is the same for both, the full-stack just features the ability to also talk to the Node.js backend when needed.

We've decided to make it easier to choose how to start by letting you choose to go the full-stack method, if you need a node.js backend to work with or just grab the client-side if you want to work with a client-side only system.

The choice is yours, and the possibilities are endless!
