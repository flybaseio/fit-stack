# fit-stack
The FIT Stack - Flybase / Interface / Thin Servers

The FIT Stack allows for building rapid MVPs, it's set up so you can choose a full-stack version with Node.js as the backend, or the client-side version which is frontend only.

The frontend code is the same for both, the full-stack just features the ability to also talk to the Node.js backend when needed.

## Branches

* [full-stack (with node)][full-stack]
* [client-side only][client-side]
